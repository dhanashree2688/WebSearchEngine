It's actually a lot more elegant than I imagined. We ordered the Sausage and Roasted Cipollini Onions pizza and some Garlic Toast to start. I really liked the pizza, especially their sausage on it.  The only downer for me was that they don't have ranch! I always need some ranch w/ my pizza so I was quite bummed otherwise they probably would've gotten a 5 star from me. Our waiter even said a lot of people actually place that request as well.  (hint hint, add ranch for customers! lol)
