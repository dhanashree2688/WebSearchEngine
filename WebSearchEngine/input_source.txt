Pizza Pizza... get it while it's hot!!!! =)

My boyfriend is always raving about this place and how great it is so he finally took me here so I can see for myself...

It's actually a lot more elegant than I imagined. We ordered the Sausage and Roasted Cipollini Onions pizza and some Garlic Toast to start. I really liked the pizza, especially their sausage on it.  The only downer for me was that they don't have ranch! I always need some ranch w/ my pizza so I was quite bummed otherwise they probably would've gotten a 5 star from me. Our waiter even said a lot of people actually place that request as well.  (hint hint, add ranch for customers! lol)

Another positive? They have really good drink specials after 8 pm. I'm not sure if it's 7 days a week but you can't beat half off their drinks. Love it!

I see what all the hype is about now. The customer service was so friendly and it's a great place for a date or even an evening with a group of friends. See you soon Scordatos! =)

I had eaten at Grimaldi's in the east valley and loved it,  so was anxious to meet friends here in Tucson.  Having come from Chicago, I'm not easily pleased, especially with pizza in Tucson.  First, let me say that our waitress was excellent, She was friendly and attentive.  The place was packed, with very little room to walk through the sea of tables.  I ordered a zinfandel and when it came, it was watered down, a lot.  The pizza was large, over priced, and the crust was mushy.  I will not return.
